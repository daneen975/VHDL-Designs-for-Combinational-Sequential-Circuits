VHDL for Sequential Circuits: Implementing a Customized State Machine

This lab focuses on the design, simulation, and verification of a custom Finite State Machine (FSM) using VHDL. Students implement either a Mealy or Moore state machine to cycle through each digit of their student ID, using different state assignment strategies and verifying their behavior through simulation and display.

Key Features
- Sequentially displays all 9 digits of the student ID (e.g., 500435429)
- Handles non-valid or error states by displaying E on the 7-segment display
- Includes complete state table, logic equations, and VHDL-based FSM design
- Modular design enables reuse of previous lab components (e.g., display module)
